Pillar Technology Kata Code Test

I used Visual Studio 2017 Community to build this program, installed products are listed below.

You should be able to open the solution and run the program or tests from Visual Studio.

You can also simply run the program from the WordSearchConsole.exe located at \WordSearchKata\WordSearchConsole\bin\Debug

***Note about Custom Puzzle Entry***
I used this to copy puzzles in from notepad for testing. It does not have any input checking and will cause errors if input is not properly formatted.
